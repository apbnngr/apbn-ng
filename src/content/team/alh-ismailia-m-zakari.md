Smaila M. Zakari qualified as a Chartered Accountant 31 years ago. For the past 24 years, he has earned a living entirely from working as a Partner at Ahmed Zakari & Co. (Chartered Accountants) - a leading indigenous Small & Medium-Sized Accountancy Practice firm he co-founded with other professional colleagues in 1998. He is currently the Managing Partner of the firm.





As Managing Partner, Ismaila is responsible for providing leadership and strategic direction to a resourceful team of more than 50, mostly Y-Generation professionals specializing in helping clients - mainly SMEs, listed entities, public sector, and Not-for-Profit organizations to achieve their business goals by providing high-quality accounting, audit & assurance, tax, insolvency, Islamic finance, and consulting service engagements.





Quality in auditing and financial reporting is at the heart of Ismaila's daily work, and he is keen to help build trust in the profession and ensure that quality is maintained through continuous improvement. He believes that high-quality auditing, financial reporting, sustainability disclosure, and assurance standards are at the core of building strong economies and institutions and are essential to raising standards of living and prosperity of the citizenry.





Ismaila's lifetime passion and dedication have been to serve the global accountancy profession. Over the past 21 years, he has made modest contributions as a volunteer. At the peak of his voluntary services to the global profession, he was elected in November 2019 to serve on the Board of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) - the global organization for the Accountancy profession comprising 175 members and associates from over 130 countries and jurisdictions.





On 15 November 2022, Ismaila was re-elected to serve on the IFAC Board for a second term of 3 years (2023-2025). As an IFAC Board Member, representing the Africa/Middle-East Region, Ismaila's role is to serve the public interest, bringing his unique SMP and developing economy perspectives to the work of shaping IFAC strategy at the highest level, tackling diverse emerging challenges facing the profession, and enhancing the relevance and reputation.
