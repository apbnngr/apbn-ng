Surv. Akinloye Olufemi Oyegbola was born on September 7th, 1955. He is the first of the five children of Deacon Joshua Oyewole Oyegbola, a Management Consultant, and Deaconess (Mrs.) Victoria Ibidunni Oyegbola, a teacher, both of blessed memory.





He completed his primary and secondary school education at Surulere Baptist School and Birch Freeman High School, both in Surulere, Lagos State, graduating in 1967 and 1973 respectively. Initially, he briefly attended the Federal School of Science, Victoria Island, Lagos, before commencing his employment with the Federal Ministry of Works, Survey Department in May 1975 to embark on a course in Surveying.





He successfully finished the Basic Course in Surveying (Basic 17) at the School of Surveying, Oyo, Oyo State, in 1976. Following this, he was posted to the Ilorin Field Headquarters of the Federal Survey Department. In 1977, he was awarded a Federal Government Scholarship to pursue a degree in Surveying Engineering at the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Geodesy in Sofia, Bulgaria. He returned in 1983 with a Master's degree, M.Sc. (Surveying Engineering). By 1989, he had earned registration as a Surveyor from the Surveyors Council of Nigeria (SURCON).





During his National Youth Service Corps tenure, he served as a lecturer at the National Open University, Lagos. Feeling underutilized, he sought redeployment after five months, leading to his assignment at Niger Build Construction Company Ltd, where he served out his service term and continued as a retained employee.





In 1985, he joined Yaba College of Technology (Yaba Tech), Lagos, as a part-time lecturer, transitioning to a full-time lecturer in the Civil Engineering Department in 1986. After six years of full-time lecturing at Yaba Tech, he resigned from his position in 1991 to establish his private practice. His goal was to become involved in the administration of his professional institution, the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, to contribute to its growth. Despite resigning, he maintained a role as a part-time lecturer in the Civil Engineering Department for an additional 23 years. He initiated his private practice in the same year, establishing Akin Oyegbola & Associates, a Surveying and GIS Consultants firm, as well as Stroytel Concerns Ltd.





Surv. Akin Oyegbola assumed the position of Secretary General of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS) from 2000 to 2002. During his tenure, he led eleven NIS representatives to the Surveyors Council of Nigeria and also represented the Institution in the Council of the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN). Within the same year, he contested and secured the position of Financial Secretary.





This marked the commencement of his uninterrupted ten-year membership on the Executive Council of APBN. In 2008, he was appointed as the Secretary General of APBN, stepping down from the Council in 2010. Simultaneously, he became the Vice President (National) of the NIS, which also earned him a seat on the Governing Council of the Federal School of Surveying, Oyo. He served as an examiner for the Surveyors' Council of Nigeria from 2001 to 2012.





In 1993, he joined the Association of Private Practicing Surveyors of Nigeria and later took on the role of President of a Rotary Club in 1998, attaining the Paul Harris fellowship in 1996. His career within NIS continued, with him assuming the position of Deputy President in 2014 and subsequently rising to the presidency from 2016 to 2018.





Providence made it possible for him to return to APBN as the 1st Deputy. Between 2003 and 2005, he held the position of Chairman of the Lagos State Branch of APBN.
