        <p>
          Some highly placed and well-meaning Nigerian Professionals identified
          the need for the creation of a unified body of professionals to render
          advice to the government on national policy issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Erstwhile, on matters of business, commerce, industry and labor, the
          opinions of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce Industry,
          Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), the Manufacturers Association of
          Nigeria (MAN) and the National Employers Consultative Association (NECA)
          are frequently sought by Government before major policy decisions are
          taken or implementation made.
        </p>

        <p>
          There has been no parallel national body or association embracing
          various professional organizations in Nigeria which can be called upon
          by the Government to advise it.
        </p>

        <Image
          src={theAssociation}
          width={1000}
          height={576}
          alt="the association"
          class="aspect-[1000/576] w-1/2 hidden md:block float-left"
          format="webp"/>

        <p>
          Consequently, when policy matters of national importance are to be made,
          the Government either neglects to seek consultations or turns to a few
          known individuals whose views may not necessarily reflect those of the
          various Professional Institutions. Yet, we all know that the soundness
          of a policy depends largely on the quality and integrity of the advice
          on which it is formulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initiative to bridge this gap brought about the body of
          Professionals: The Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN).
          APBN is an umbrella body of recognised professional Institutes,
          Institutions and Associations promoting a new era of cooperation among
          professionals in Nigeria. APBN is the veritable platform designed for
          member-bodies to speak with one voice while at the same time giving
          professional and proper technical advice to Government on matters
          affecting the professionals and their practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is the apex organization comprising, for now, thirty professional
          bodies, whose main objective is to provide Nigeria with an effective
          forum for transmitting to the Government the aggregate views of the
          nation's professionals on matters of public interest which they are
          competent to express, informed and enlightened views. APBN was given
          official Federal government recognition as the third leg of the tripod
          of the Organised Private Sector (OPS) in January 1992.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to 1992, APBN had embarked upon several activities since 1983. APBN
          is actively involved in promoting and enhancing the status of
          professional bodies by ensuring maximal utilization of the talents,
          skills and knowledge of the Nigerian professionals. APBN believes that
          human welfare problems are multi-dimensional in nature and for this
          reason it employs a multi disciplinary approach to problem solving. In
          this regard, APBN discourages traditional professional prejudice,
          intolerance, and self-centredness.
        </p>

        <p>
          APBN believes that, in the interest of the wider society, no profession
          needs to operate in isolation of the other professional bodies and by
          that very fact advocates frequent interfacing and cooperation amongst
          professions.
